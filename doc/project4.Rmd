# Design<F4>
From a high level, this program has been built with a class that contains the UI separate from any workflow logic.  Being designed with a standard object-oriented approach has separated concerns of the role and responsibility of each class -- as OOD is intended to do.

## Decisions  
* I chose not to use the comparable interface on the Thing class, because I don't believe it is needed and I don't want dead code.
* TDD was used for some areas of the program to ensure that changes in future iterations do not alter the functionality of those methods.
* A map was used in the World class to track all objects for two main reasons.  First, the complexity of creating the model is greatly reduced since parent objects can be found without having to search for them.  Second, this allows for O(n) lookup time for any object that exists in the World.  So for the purposes of this class, the time needed to create the World is drastically reduced -- especially for very large input files.
* Each class that uses a thread is left as responsible for its own thread.  This wasn't as much of a decision as it was a convention.
* One of the goals stated that the GUI should show the current resources that have been acquired, resource requests that are outstanding, and the availability of specific skills.  My approach for this was a sort of minimum viable product approach so as to avoid going too far outside the scope of this course.  It didn't seem to me that show these items had much to do with OOP or concurrency -- and I felt that I had adequately demonstrated my capabilities with the Swing library in such a way that showing these items in a different way wouldn't bring any additional value at this time.  My specific approach to these items was as follows:
  + Available persons/skills: Next to each person, I added a substring that states whether each person is available or unavailable.  This can be used to see which specific skills are available as well as how many of each.
  + Resources acquired: If a job is progressing, then the skills required for that ship are acquired by that job until the job is either cancelled or completed.  The specific skills that are acquired can be seen on the string that represents the job in the JTree.
  + Outstanding resource requests: If a job is not progressing, then the skills required for that job all stand as unfulfilled requests.  The reason that all resources stand as unfulfilled is because the ship does not take and hold those resources until all are available.  I considered showing only the skills that aren't available, but felt that this would be an inaccurate representation of unfulfilled skills.
* When a job requires no skills, I determined that this was an automated job on the ship that required no personnel to complete.  This could be something like a self-diagnostic test that the ship needs to perform while in port or just time that it takes to receive its full payload of fuel for the next trip.
* 
## Meanings
The various classes, packages, variables, and methods in this program are organized in a logical manner that show good practices in object-oriented design.  Each of the items has been placed in such a way that it has some sort of direct relationship with its containing parent or its contained child.

### Classes
All classes assume no knowledge of their calling class whether by passing context or interface.

#### The *Thing* Package
Each class in the *thing* package as well as classes in the sub packages of *thing* represent real world objects that reflect their name.

#### Other Classes
The PortTime class, in a similar manner represents the time of a port.  Due to ambiguous requirements, however, the developer was unable to determine the intended use of this class.  Therefore, it is assumed that this class will be better integrated in a future iteration.
 
### Variables
In each class, there are sets of instance variables that represent a *has-a* relationship between the class and the item that variable holds.  For instance, a SeaPort has a (or many) Dock(s).

## Methods
The SeaPortProgram class contains the heart of creating the world including all of the logic for parsing out the input file, creating the objects, and modeling a world that represents what is defined in the input file.  While the requirement documentation *suggests* that a scanner should be used, a string tokenizer was used instead.  While this adds some additional coding overhead, 

# User's Guide
This serves as a guide for all you need to know to get up and running with this program

## How to start the program
To compile, cd into the src directory and run the command `javac *.java */*.java */*/*.java`.  Once that command has completed, run `java -classpath <path-to-src-folder> main.SeaPortProgram`.

## How to create a world
1. Click "Select File".
2. Navigate to and select a valid input file.
3. Select "Open".
4. World is automatically modeled.  Notice the output that matches the data in the chosen input file.

## Search
Searches using regex provide the user with more control over the matching pattern.  Matches look at three criteria: name, index, and skill.

### How to search
1. Input a valid java regex engine pattern in the search box. (Valid regex patterns for the java regex engine can be obtained [here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).
2. Click "Search".
Searching returns a list of all *Things* that have a Name or Index that match the criteria.  Some additional cases exist such as searching the skills of a Person or the duration of a Job.

### Examples
* Search Pattern: "ar"
    + Matches "Sara"
    + Does not Match "Archie"
* Search Pattern: "[A|a]r"
    + Matches "Sara" and "Archie"
For more extended documentation on regex patterns, [go here](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html).

## Sorting
Sorting can be done on all lists and sub lists in the program.  For convenience, the sort dialog will remain open until the user closes it.

### How to sort
1. Once a file has loaded, the `sort` button can be clicked which will open a sort picking dialog.
2. On the sort picking dialog, select the desired sort options and click `sort`.
3. Repeat until the desired sorts are achieved.

### How to cancel or suspend a job
_Note_: Cancelled jobs are handled similar to a completed job, but have no additional effort applied.  This allows the ship to undock.
1. While jobs are running, click "Suspend" or "Cancel".
2. Enter the index of the job you wish to interact with.
3. Click "Ok" and note that the job has stopped progressing.

## Special Features
The JTree automatically refreshes its Ship and Job nodes to show progress in a near-realtime manner.  If a new file is loaded, the JTree abandoned and reloaded with the new incoming data model.
 
# Test Plan  
1. Base Case
    + **Input:** (1.txt) Using the input file outlined in the requirements documentation
    + **Expected:** Ouput that matches the output outlined in the documentation.  And All ships will be immediately undocked.
    + **Result:** An exact match between the expected output and the actual output.  And all ships are immediately undocked.
2. Very large input file
    + **Input:** (2.txt) Using an input file that is extremely large to ensure no allocation issues
    + **Expected:** No errors and output that displays an appropriate data structure to match the input.
    + **Result:** An out of memory error is thrown and no further actions are completed by the program.  This is caused by the OS limitation on the number of threads it will allow to be thrown on the allocated heap.
3. Searching "ar"
    * **Input:** (1.txt) Containing names with `\*ar\*` and `Ar\*`.
    * **Expected:** Matches with names only containing `\*ar\*`.
    * **Result:** Search returns only names that contain `\*ar\*`. (See figure 1)
4. Sorting All Ascending by name
    * **Input:** (4.txt) An input file containing multiple ports.
    * **Expected:** All items in the tree will be sorted in ascending order by name.
    * **Result:** All items are sorted in ascending order in the tree. (See figure 2)
5. Unit tests
    + Unit tests were written to ensure that units of code perform the same basic function even after changes are made.
    + **Expected:** All unit tests should pass.
    + **Result:** All unit tests pass.
6. Small Data Set
    * **Input** (4.txt) An input file containing a small set of data
    * **Expected:** All jobs will progress to completion and docked ships will be replaced with ships in que.
    * **Result:** All ships have all jobs completed while docked.
7. Large Data Set
    * **Input** (3.txt) An input file containing a relatively large set of data
    * **Expected:** All jobs will progress to completion and docked ships will be replaced with ships in que.
    * **Result:** All ships have all jobs completed while docked.

# Lessons Learned
In the coming sections, consideration will be given to particular pain points, gleanings, and takeaways.

## Concurrency
I haven't worked with concurrency in Java for several years.  Having said that, I have been using GoLang at work for the past year and have come to love the implementations of the libs surrounding concurrency -- so much so that it was painful to not have go routines and channels.  Java has, however, become slightly nicer in this area with the introduction of lambda functions.  I haven't looked into it, but it almost makes me think that functions can be handled as first-class citizens in Java now.  I'd be interested to know!

## About This Documentation
Since discovering Pandoc, I have written all of my professional documentation and papers in markdown and used Pandoc to convert them to whatever end format I require.  Markdown allows me to focus on content rather than formatting and thus saves great amounts of time.  One particular hurdle in writing this documentation was finding a way to use \LaTeX\ to handle the formatting in a way that was consistent with the APA style guide.  As a result, I came across a set of tools that allows me to continue using Pandoc to pipe everything through a template that \LaTeX\ uses to ultimately format my paper perfectly according to the APA style -- and all I ever did was write this in markdown with some yaml front matter.  A glorious combination when paired with Vim. 

## New Classes Used

### JScrollPane
While I purposefully avoid Java's built in UI libraries, it came as no surprise when I found myself using the JScrollPane class for the first time in this program.  I did find JScrollPane to be comparatively easy to work with for the sake of just getting a scroll view set up.

### JTree
I found JTree to be easy to work with and rather intuitive.  It did force me to refactor all of my `toString()` methods -- but for the better.
JTree has proven to be quite painful when working with concurrency.  Since it is modeling a wide array of data, it is easy to miss a section that should be synchronized.

### JSplitPane
Once again, easy and intuitive.  I don't quite like JSplitPane, however, because I feel that it paves the way for a bad UX.  That's purely opinion at this point, though.

## Future Iterations
Project 1: In a future iteration, I would like to focus on pushing all UI driven events to the EDT and all other tasks onto other threads.  In the words of Vern Gosdin, "This ain't my first rodeo."  Additionally, I would likely opt for some sort of utility class if too much begins to be repeated among the various classes.  I already see where this might be possible as the search expands and I could offload the matching to a static utility method that just grabs the specified fields from each of the classes for comparison.  Thing implements the comparable interface, but makes no actual use of the interface.  Currently, the compareTo() method is overridden in Thing, but in the future, Thing need to be an abstract class and all subclasses will need to override this comparable method.  Lastly, there is plenty of room for additional unit tests.  New unit tests should be written on any logic code before any alterations are made for concurrency to ensure proper results.

Project 2: The main UI class is getting cumbersome.  I would like to see it be split out into a second class as appropriate.  The two UI classes have some repetitive code that could go into a static method of a utility class.  The search could allow for more robust options such as searching only on Persons.

Project 3: Similar to the previous project, I feel that the primary UI file is getting very cumbersome.  While it is fairly well split into functional areas, it is calling desperately for a refactor to place actions and utils into a util class.  Some additional work should also be done to clean up some small bugs with the JTree not rendering the nodes properly.  I think this could be fixed by using an invokeLater() or using a graphics buffer.

Project 4: If I were to continue with an additional iteration outside of this course, I would refactor the way that the classes from the SeaPort down interact.  I don't think it makes much sense for the seaport to assign personnel to jobs -- instead, I would probably consider something more like a model where the Job can reach out to the resource pool and request the resources it needs.  In addition, I would consider extending the functionality of the user interface to provide more options for interaction (assuming this would be a real-world application).
